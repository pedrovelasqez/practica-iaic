Congratulations on downloading a source code distribution of Jess.
You'll need to compile Jess before you can run it. If you're on a
UNIX-like system, you should be able to easily edit the enclosed
Makefile and build Jess using a simple "make". The manual contains
instructions on building Jess on Windows without using Makefile -- as
well as a wealth of other useful information. Open docs/index.html in
your favorite Web brower.

The directory "examples" contains some tiny example scripts written in
the Jess rule language. The directory jess/examples/ contains several
more simple programs written in Java. The manual includes instructions
on using these samples.
